A Puppet module that can construct files from fragments.

Please see the comments in the various .pp files for details
as well as posts on my blog at www.devco.net

Released under the Apache 2.0 licence

KNOWN ISSUES:
- In 0.24.8 you will see inintended notifies, if you build a file
  in a run, the next run will also see it as changed.  This is due
  to how 0.24.8 does the purging of unhandled files, this is improved
  in 0.25.x and we cannot work around it in our code.

- At present you cannot change the ownership of the file by just setting
  the property on the resources, we have a work around in mind.
